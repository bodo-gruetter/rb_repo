## 3.1 The starting model
We have now examined a wide variety of variables and their effects on the target variable using a variety of graphs. Now we want to develop a good model from these findings and compare it with models of different degrees of complexity. To achieve this we must first define a starting model that allows us to be further developed.

# 4. The igraph-Package
## 4.1 An introduction into the graph theory
Using the igraph library, graph algorithms can be easily implemented in R, large graphs can be handled and visualized quickly. Before we can do this, some terms in the context of graphs must be defined. The theoretical basis of graphs is graph theory. It is a branch of mathematics.

A *graph* is a network of relationships between different entities from the real world. These entities are represented in the graph as *nodes*. The nodes have *properties* that describe the corresponding object in the real world. They make it an individual. Nodes are related to each other. They are connected by *edges*.

**A simple example**
Graphs are suitable for displaying data from social networks like Facebook and Twitter. An introductory example will go into this in more detail. The following figure shows a very simple graph with three nodes, five edges and a property name - represented as a key-value construct - in each node. The graph shows a small social network between three users. Billy follows Harry and Harry follows Billy. Ruth and Harry also follow each other. Ruth follows Billy, but Billy does not follow Ruth.

## 4.2 Graphs in igraph
In igraph graphs are represented with the class "igraph". Graphs can be directed (D) as seen in the previous example, or they can be undirected (U). Furthermore, graphs can be named (N), weighted (W) - that means that the edges have different weights - and bipartite (B). A bipartite graph has relations between elements of two sets. In contrast to the conventional graph, the relations do not exist from node to node, but from element in set A to element in set B.

In igraph, typically two parameters indicating the size of the graph are specified to form a graph. The number of vertices indicates how many nodes the graph contains and the number of edges indicates how many edges the graph conains.

**A simple example**
Now we want to recreate the simple example of the small social network between Billy, Ruth and Harry. For this we use the "igraph" package, which must first be imported. In this example we will build a graph from a data.frame. So first we have to save the data in data.frames before we can form the graph. These are two data.frames. "user" includes the users Billy, Ruth and Harry. "relations" contains the relations between the three users.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

users <- data.frame(name=c("Billy", "Harry", "Ruth"))
relations <- data.frame(from=c("Billy", "Harry", "Harry", "Ruth", "Ruth"), to=c("Harry", "Billy", "Ruth", "Harry", "Billy"))

g <- graph_from_data_frame(relations, directed=TRUE, vertices=users)
print(g)

```

As the output shows, it is a directed, named graph with 3 nodes and 5 edges. The nodes each have an attribute: name. In the last line, the relations representing the same image as in the figure of the last section are given. Now we ask ourselves the question how we can display the graph visually so that it looks similar to the figure just mentioned.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

plot(g)

```

We use a simple function that we have often used to create charts: plot. As we see, the graphic corresponds to our little social network between Billy, Ruth and Harry.
